# Zhang and Paxton Auroral Model
This is a model described in the paper

Y. Zhang, L.J. Paxton, An empirical Kp-dependent global auroral model based on TIMED/GUVI FUV data, Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, Volume 70, Issues 8–9, 2008, Pages 1231-1242, ISSN 1364-6826, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jastp.2008.03.008.

Please refer to Appendix A of the paper:

Here is an example plot for kp=3: the black and red-dashed curves are the poleward and equatorward boundaries at flux above 0.25 $erg/s/cm^{2}$, respectively.
